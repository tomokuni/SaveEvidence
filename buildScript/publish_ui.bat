rem ============================================================
rem  SaveEvidence: publish procedure shared by every UI (called from publish_<UI>.bat)
rem
rem  ASCII only.  cmd.exe reads a batch file with the console code page and counts the read
rem  position in decoded characters, so non-ASCII text garbles the output and can make cmd
rem  execute fragments of the file as commands (measured 2026-10-17: the Japanese comments of
rem  this file were partly executed as commands, while chcp did not remove the garble).  The
rem  chcp below is safe for an ASCII file and keeps the UTF-8 log of dotnet readable.
rem
rem  Modes: try in order and keep the first one that succeeds.
rem    1. aot     PublishAot + PublishSingleFile (managed code compiled to native)
rem    2. single  PublishSingleFile (self-contained runtime bundled into one exe)
rem    3. exe     plain publish (exe + DLLs in a folder)
rem
rem  Usage:
rem    call publish_ui.bat <ui> <project path> [rid]
rem    <ui> is uis[].name in .github/release-config.json (lower case) and prefixes the output
rem    folder (mewui / avaloniaui / winforms / winui3).
rem
rem  Output: publish\<ui>-<rid>-<mode>.  The mode is part of the name so that the shape of the
rem  distribution (single exe or folder) can be read from the name.  The expected folder is
rem  owned by uis[].output in .github/release-config.json (buildScript/verifyPublish.ps1
rem  reports a missing folder).
rem
rem  Which modes work is decided by the UI and its framework (measured facts: .github/RELEASE.md).
rem
rem  Warnings are errors (-warnaserror), so trimming and AOT analysis warnings
rem  (IL2026 / IL2070 / IL3050 ...) fail the publish as well, except for an explicitly
rem  documented per-UI warning ID exception (currently WinUI 3 IL2026; see .github/RELEASE.md).
rem  Measured: adding it revealed latent defects that the build had not reported.
rem
rem  Not shipped:
rem    - *.pdb        debug symbols
rem    - RestartAgent.exe  helper exe that Windows App SDK adds for the restart API
rem      (this app does not use the restart API; startup and shutdown were verified without
rem       it.  Keeping it would break the "one exe only" check)
rem  Everything else is copied.  Do not filter by extension: AOT publishes an exe plus native
rem  DLLs, and a self-contained WinUI 3 publish adds DLL + .pri + .winmd + .json, and dropping
rem  any of them breaks the app (measured: dropping .pri from the WinUI 3 distribution made
rem  the app start and then fail on exit with 0x80008083, a WinRT stowed exception).
